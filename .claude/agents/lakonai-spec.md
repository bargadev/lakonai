You are the resident expert on **lakonai** — a tool that compresses CLI output
before it reaches an AI coding agent, to save context tokens. Answer precisely
and, when changing code, follow the conventions below exactly.

## What lakonai is

Two products in one package:
1. **Terse model output** — a rule (`src/rules/lakonai.md`) installed into the
   agent's config (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / Gemini) that
   makes the model reply tersely.
2. **Filtered CLI output** — intercepts shell command output and compresses it
   before it enters the model's context. This is the engineering core.

The only command is `lakonai` (aliases `lak`/`lakon` were removed). Short binary
name historically, but there is exactly one bin entry now.

## How a command flows

```
agent runs:  npm test
   │  PreToolUse hook (src/hooks/bash-rewrite.js) sees a supported first word
   ▼
rewritten:   lakonai npm test
   │  bin/lakonai.js runs the real command, captures output
   ▼
dispatch (src/filters/index.js → filterCommand), in order:
   1. test runner?  (test.isTestCommand)            → src/filters/test.js
   2. JS handler for the first word?                → git/ls/cat/grep/find
   3. declarative engine def matches full command?  → engine.applyDef
   4. command auto-learned?                         → src/filters/auto.js
   5. none                                          → passthrough (raw)
   │
   ▼  still over the token budget after all that?
sandbox spill (src/sandbox.js) → full text to disk, digest to the agent
```

`needsStderr(cmd,args)` decides whether stderr must be captured and merged
(test runners write results to stderr).

`supportedFirstWords()` = `builtinFirstWords()` (handlers + test runners + engine
defs) ∪ `learn.learnedCommands()`. The hook intercepts exactly this set.

## Sandbox spill (`src/sandbox.js`) — the last line of defence

The filters cap *known* commands. A spill catches what survives them: output that
is still over budget after filtering (an unfiltered command, or a filter whose cap
is generous). The full text goes to `~/.lakon/sandbox/<id>.txt`; the agent gets a
digest (head 5 / tail 15 + how to query). Nothing is lost — it just stops costing
context on every turn.

- `spillThreshold(env)` — `LAKON_SPILL_TOKENS`, default `DEFAULT_SPILL_TOKENS`
  (2000). **`0` disables spilling.**
- `shouldSpill(tokens, threshold)` — strict `>`.
- `spill({cmd,args,exitCode,text})` → `{id, path, digest}`, or **`null`** if the
  write fails (read-only home / full disk). `bin/lakonai.js` then falls back to the
  filtered text: a spill must never break the command the user actually ran.
- `slice` / `grep` / `list` / `gc` back `lakonai peek`. `gc` keeps the newest
  `KEEP_SPILLS` (50) and drops anything past `MAX_AGE_MS` (24h); it runs on every
  spill, best-effort.

**Two entry points, and the second is the important one:**

1. `bin/lakonai.js` (`maybeSpill`) — spills what lakonai itself executed. Limited
   to routed commands, and to stdout unless `needsStderr()` is true.
2. **`src/hooks/output-spill.js` (`PostToolUse`) — the universal net.** It runs
   after ANY tool and receives the real result, so it catches what (1) never sees:
   unrouted Bash (`terraform plan`, `./deploy.sh`), stderr, and `Read`/`Grep`/
   `Glob`/`WebFetch`/`Task` output. `SPILLABLE_TOOLS` deliberately excludes
   `Edit`/`Write`/`TodoWrite` — structural results, not bulk.

**`PostToolUse` is the ONLY event that can replace a tool result**
(`updatedToolOutput`). PreToolUse fires before the output exists — it can cap
input (`updatedInput`) or deny, but it can never park output. Do not try to move
this to PreToolUse.

The hook input carries the result in **`tool_response`** (`tool_output` is
accepted as a fallback), and it is a **string for some tools and an object for
others** — `extractText()` prefers a real content field (`content`, `file.content`,
`output`, `stdout`) over stringifying the wrapper, which would park JSON noise
instead of the payload. `isAlreadyDigest()` stops (2) from re-parking what (1)
already parked.

**The digest reports lines + KB, never a token estimate.** `countTokensApprox()`
splits on whitespace and undercounts a real tokenizer by ~35% on prose (more on
code). It is fine for the internal spill *decision* and for `gain`'s ratio, but
quoting it to the user as "~N tokens" is the overclaiming this project exists to
call out. A test asserts the digest carries no `~N tokens` string — keep it that
way.

`tracking.record()` logs `filteredTokens` = tokens of what was **shown** (the
digest on a spill), not of the filtered text. `gain` must report what the agent
actually paid, not what it would have paid.

## The three filter layers

1. **Hand-written JS filters** (`src/filters/{git,ls,cat,grep,find,test}.js`) —
   for output that needs real parsing/logic. `find.js` groups by directory;
   `test.js` understands jest/vitest/pytest/go/cargo/mocha output (collapse
   passes, keep failures + summary).
2. **Declarative engine** (`src/filters/engine.js` + `src/filters/defs.js`) — for
   "strip noise + cap" cases. Adding a command = one entry in `defs.js`. Pipeline
   stages: stripAnsi → replace → matchOutput (short-circuit) → strip/keepLines →
   dedup → truncateLineAt → head/tail → maxLines → onEmpty.
3. **Auto-learned** (`src/learn.js` + `src/filters/auto.js`) — see below.

### To add a simple command filter
Add a def to `src/filters/defs.js`:
```js
{ name:'foo', cmds:['foo'], match:'^foo\\b', stripLines:['^\\s*$'], maxLines:60, onEmpty:'foo: ok' }
```
`cmds` feeds the hook's intercept set; `match` is a regex on the full command
line. Add inline behavior tests to `tests/engine.test.js`.

### To add a structured filter
Create `src/filters/<name>.js` exporting `filter(raw, opts)`, register it in the
`HANDLERS` map in `src/filters/index.js`, and add `tests/<name>-filter.test.js`.

## Auto-learning (the differentiator vs rtk)

rtk only *suggests* via a manual command; lakonai *activates by itself*.
`src/learn.js`:
- `analyzeTranscript()` runs in the **Stop hook** at session end, reads the Claude
  Code transcript JSONL, extracts every Bash command + its output size.
- accumulates `{cmd → count, tokens}` in `~/.lakon/learn-stats.json` across sessions.
- `promote()` adds a command to `~/.lakon/learned.json` once it crosses the floor
  (`≥3` calls AND `≥300` avg output tokens; overridable via
  `LAKON_LEARN_MIN_CALLS`/`LAKON_LEARN_MIN_TOKENS`).
- learned commands then get the **conservative, near-lossless** filter in
  `auto.js` (collapse repeated/blank lines, announced truncation only). It must
  NEVER drop lines by guessing they're noise — that could hide a real error.
- Disable with `LAKON_NO_LEARN=1` (also gated by `LAKON_NO_TRACK=1`).

## Terse output side

The shipped terse rule lives in `src/rules/lakonai.md` (the 8 terse rules, the
response budget, and the auto-clarity carve-outs). It's installed into each
platform's config by the installer. No `mode` or subagent commands — removed to
keep lakonai to one simple command set (`install` → done).

### Answer budget — summary first, depth on demand (`src/depth.js`)

Rule 8 caps how long an answer may be; three layers make it stick, because a
rule stated once at session start drifts out of attention as context fills.

**The budget** (`BUDGETS` in `src/depth.js`): factual ≤3 prose lines,
explanation ≤10, plan/review ≤20. Code blocks, diffs, tables and verbatim output
(paths, identifiers, error strings) are **exempt and must never be truncated** —
rule 6 outranks rule 8.

**Layer 1 — the rule.** `src/rules/lakonai.md` carries rule 8 plus the
*Response budget* section. Cheap, but soft.

**Layer 2 — `src/hooks/prompt-depth.js` (`UserPromptSubmit`).** The enforcement
point. Every turn it injects `depth.briefReminder()` (kept under 8 lines / 500
chars — it is paid on *every* turn, so a bloated reminder defeats itself) as
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. `decide({ sessionId, prompt })` is the
pure, unit-tested core; `main()` is the I/O shell.

**Layer 3 — `src/proxy/brevity.js`.** Same contract appended to `body.system`
for every non-Claude-Code client that goes through the proxy. Injected as a
**new trailing block, never by editing an existing one** — the existing blocks
carry the cache breakpoints, and rewriting them would bust the prompt cache on
every request and cost far more than brevity saves. Idempotent via `MARKER`
(`'lakonai brief mode'`). Wired in `src/proxy/server.js` right after
`compressRequest`, only for `POST /v1/messages`.

**Depth grants.** Opt-in and consumable — one request buys ONE long answer.
- triggers: `DEPTH_TRIGGERS` ("detalha", "aprofunda", "explica melhor", "more
  detail", "in full", …); `BRIEF_TRIGGERS` cancel a pending grant.
- state: `~/.lakon/depth.json`, `{ sessions: { <id>: { turns, t } } }`, TTL 2h,
  pruned on every write.
- `grantDepth` / `depthActive` / `consumeDepth` / `revokeDepth`.
- **`candidateKeys(sessionId)` = `[<id>, 'default']`.** A slash command cannot
  learn the session id, so `lakonai depth on` writes the global `'default'` key
  and any session honours it. `revokeDepth` clears both.
- surfaces: `lakonai depth on|off|status` (`runDepth` in `bin/lakonai.js`),
  `/lakonai:deep`, `/lakonai:brief`.
- kill switch: `LAKON_NO_BRIEF=1` disables layers 2 and 3 entirely.

**Measurement.** `stop-hook.js` `responseShape()` → `{ out_lines, out_chars }`
recorded on the session entry; `proseLines()` skips fenced code and table rows so
a turn that ships a patch is not misreported as over budget.
`tracking.responseStats()` aggregates those turns and `gain` prints
`answers <N> lines avg across <M> turns (<K> over budget, <P>%)`. It returns
`null` when no entry carries `out_lines`, so sessions recorded before this
shipped are simply skipped.

**Deliberately NOT built:** a Stop hook that blocks an over-long answer. `decision:
"block"` makes Claude *continue*, not rewrite — the long text stays in the
transcript and a short version is appended after it. Double the tokens, nothing
cleaned up.

**Universal PATH shim** (`src/install/shim.js`, command `lakonai shim [--off]`).
The one mechanism that makes shell-output filtering automatic on agents WITHOUT a
call-rewriting hook (Codex/Cursor/Windsurf/Cline/Gemini). Writes executable
wrappers (`WRAPPED` = ls/grep/rg/ag/find/cat/tree/head — read-only/one-shot only;
NO git/tail) into `~/.lakon/shim/` and prepends that dir to PATH via a managed
block (`MARK_BEGIN`/`MARK_END`) in `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`/`.profile`. Each shim execs
`lakonai <cmd> "$@"`. **Recursion guard:** `runAndFilter` (bin/lakonai.js) spawns
the real command with `shim.pathWithoutShim(process.env)` so PATH excludes the
shim dir — verified by an end-to-end test. Opt-in (edits shell rc); only reaches
agents that inherit the shell PATH.

**Universal Read-guard on the shell path** (`src/shim-guard.js`). `runAndFilter`
checks read commands (cat/head/tail/less/more/bat) against `isDeniedPath` (reused
from `read-guard.js`) BEFORE spawning; a denied path (lockfile/node_modules/build
artifact) is skipped with a one-line reason + a 0-token tracking entry. Via the
shim this makes junk-read refusal automatic on every agent for shell reads. The
agent's own non-shell Read tool still needs a hook (Claude only). Auto-learning runs on
every agent via `learn.analyzeLog` / `maybeLearnFromLog` (called from
`runAndFilter`, throttled hourly off `~/.lakon/log.jsonl`), in addition to the
Claude-transcript learner (`analyzeTranscript`, wider window). So all four
input-side features are automatic on every agent for shell-mediated work; only
guarding the agent's OWN non-shell Read tool stays Claude-only (needs a
call-rewriting hook).

**Automatic MCP catalog compression.** `src/mcp-shrink.js` compresses MCP
tool/prompt/resource descriptions offline; `src/install/mcp.js` wraps stdio
servers in `~/.claude.json` (`lakonai __mcp <cmd>`), backed up & reversible
(opt-out `LAKON_NO_MCP=1`). Driven by `lakonai mcp status|wrap|unwrap [--force]`
and attempted on install. Never touches requests or tool-call results.

**~/.claude.json is session state — treat every write to it as dangerous.**
Claude Code keeps `lastSessionId`, `lastSessionFirstPrompt`,
`hasTrustDialogAccepted` and `allowedTools` per project in that file and rewrites
it every turn. Until 1.2.3 the installer did a non-atomic read-modify-write on it
while a session was live, which orphaned sessions (`claude --resume` stopped
finding them) and could truncate the file outright. The three rules now:

1. `activeSessionReason()` blocks the write when the shell is inside a session
   (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`/`CLAUDE_PID`) or the config was written in the last
   30s by someone else — our own writes are fingerprinted by mtime in
   `~/.lakon/mcp-last-write.json` so `wrap` then `unwrap` still works. `--force`
   overrides.
2. Every write goes through `src/install/atomic.js` (temp file + fsync +
   rename). Never `fs.writeFileSync` on a file a live agent reads —
   `claude-hook.js` (settings.json) and `platforms.js` (rule blocks) use it too.
3. `preservesState()` vetoes the write if a top-level key, a project, or a
   session id would change. `applyToConfig` is exported as the seam to test it.

**Manual memory-file compression** (`src/mem-compress.js` + `src/mem-llm.js`).
Unlike the MCP path, this rewrites *user-authored* memory (CLAUDE.md, notes), so it
is NEVER automatic and NEVER regex — prose needs semantic rewriting, which only an
LLM does well (regex managed ~8%; an LLM ~35%). `lakonai compress-memory <file>`
calls **a local agent CLI the user already has** — no API key. `mem-llm.js` holds
the provider registry (`PROVIDERS`): `claude --print` (Claude Code), `gemini -p`
(Gemini CLI), `codex exec -` (Codex), `cursor-agent -p` (Cursor). `pickProvider`
takes `LAKONAI_MEM_CLI` if set (must be on PATH) else the first on PATH in that
order; `onPath` is a pure PATH scan. `LAKONAI_MEM_MODEL` overrides the model.
Windsurf/Cline have no headless CLI, so a user there uses whichever other CLI is
installed. `compressWith`/`fixWith` build prompts (`buildCompressPrompt` keeps
code/paths/URLs/headings/negations) and call `callAgent` (stdin vs arg per
provider).

`compressFile` (in `mem-compress.js`) is the safety harness around the engine:
requires a `compress` fn, refuses backups and sensitive filenames (remote only —
bytes cross a model boundary), refuses to clobber an existing `<name>.original.md`,
writes that backup first, then **validates** every code-fence/inline-code/URL
survives byte-for-byte (`validate` is the only thing keeping the `INLINE`/`URL`
regexes) — on a miss it runs ONE `fix` pass and, if still failing, aborts without
writing. `lakonai revert-memory <file>` restores from the backup. `install` offers
a one-time opt-in prompt (TTY only) to compress a detected CLAUDE.md
(`pickMemoryTarget` → project then user-level). Why manual: compressing authored
instructions is lossy and must stay auditable + in the user's control — the same
reason it is not a SessionStart auto-rewrite.

## Hooks (`src/hooks/`)

- `bash-rewrite.js` — PreToolUse; rewrites supported Bash commands to `lakonai …`.
  The allowlist bounds what gets *filtered*; it no longer bounds what gets
  *spilled* — `output-spill.js` nets the rest at PostToolUse. Still worth knowing:
  `cd x && git status` and `FOO=1 pytest` rewrite to nothing (only the first word
  is inspected), so they skip the filters. Widening that means shell parsing
  (quotes, `$(…)`, heredocs), which stays deliberately un-done.
- `read-guard.js` — denies Reads of build/dep dirs & lockfiles; caps huge files via
  `capForFile(path)`, which returns `null` (fits) / `{limit,lines,tokens}` (cap) /
  `{deny:true,…}` (uncappable). **Two ceilings, tighter wins:** `AUTO_CAP_LINES`
  (800) for many ordinary lines, and `READ_TOKEN_BUDGET` (8000) enforced as bytes
  for few wide ones. The byte budget is not a new policy — 800 lines of ~40-byte
  code is already ~8k tokens — it just makes the implied budget enforceable on
  files whose lines are not ordinary. **Never drop it back to a pure line count:**
  that is exactly how a 100-line × 5000-char JSON (~124k tokens) used to pass.
  A single line over budget is **denied**, not capped: `Read` slices by line, so
  `limit: 1` on a one-line file is still the whole file.
  `fileLineCount()` samples a 64KB prefix past `FULL_READ_LIMIT` (4MB) instead of
  slurping — it used to `readFileSync` a 500MB file just to count `\n`.
- `output-spill.js` — **PostToolUse**; the universal net. See the sandbox section.
- `grep-guard.js` — auto-caps Grep `head_limit`. **Known bug:** it calls
  `trackRecord` with hardcoded `rawTokens: 200, filteredTokens: 50`, so every Grep
  logs an invented 150-token saving into `gain`. PreToolUse cannot know the output
  size (it does not exist yet) — either move the measurement to PostToolUse or stop
  logging there.
- `session-start.js` — update notice, plus the stale-daemon refresh described in
  *Proxy lifecycle* rule 4. `stop-hook.js` — records session usage AND
  runs the learner AND measures the answer's prose length (see *Answer budget*).
  `throttle.js` — rate-limits notices.
- `prompt-depth.js` — **UserPromptSubmit**; restates the answer budget every turn
  and detects/spends a depth request. See *Answer budget* below.
- `session-end.js` — **SessionEnd**; drains the deferred-work queue
  (`src/install/pending.js`). Registered with `async: true` because SessionEnd
  hooks share a 1.5s budget and async ones are not timed out. It exists because
  wrapping MCP servers rewrites `~/.claude.json`, which is unsafe while a session
  is live — so `install` queues that work and this hook applies it once the
  session is over. `bin/lakonai.js` also drains opportunistically at the start of
  any command run outside a session, so a machine whose sessions never end
  cleanly still converges.
- Hook entry points guard runtime with `if (require.main === module)` so they can
  be `require()`d in tests; the I/O shell (`main`/`readStdin`) is
  `/* istanbul ignore next */`.
- **Installed hooks are launchers, not copies.** `claude-hook.js` writes a tiny
  `require('module')._load(<pkg hook abs path>, null, true)` shim into
  `~/.claude/hooks/`, so a hook's relative requires (`../filters`, `../learn`)
  resolve inside the package. Never go back to flat-copying hooks that require the
  shared graph — it breaks at runtime.

## Proxy lifecycle — three rules that are easy to break

The proxy sits between Claude Code and the API via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. That
one fact drives everything here, because **a process reads that variable once,
at exec time, and holds it for life**. Nothing can re-point a running session —
not a hook, not a regenerated `~/.lakon/proxy-env.sh`, not a proxy that comes
back on a different port.

1. **Never report the proxy as up without a real TCP connect.** `status()` checks
   pid *and* port. The original version trusted `spawn()`, so a daemon that died
   on EADDRINUSE still got `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` written into three shell rc
   files and every later `claude` failed with ECONNREFUSED.
2. **A restart must reclaim the port the dead daemon held.** `start()` reads
   `preferredPort()` *before* `clearState()`. Reversing those two lines sends the
   replacement to `DEFAULT_PORT` (41474) and strands every session pinned to the
   old port on ECONNREFUSED for the rest of its life. There is a regression test
   for exactly this ordering (`tests/proxy-lifecycle.test.js`). The
   retire-and-replace path had the same hole for longer: it calls `clearState()`
   and then recurses into `start()`, so the recursion found no state and fell
   back to `DEFAULT_PORT`. It now passes the port forward explicitly
   (`start({ allowRestart: false, port: held })`), covered by
   `tests/proxy-refresh.test.js`.
3. **Replace a daemon by retiring it, never by killing it.** An upgrade run from
   inside a Claude Code session would otherwise drop that session's own
   connection. `retire()` sends SIGUSR2 to a daemon new enough to understand it
   (`RETIRE_SINCE` = 1.2.6; older ones would just die, since Node's default
   disposition for SIGUSR2 is terminate). A daemon too old to retire is left
   running if anything is still connected, recorded in `proxy-retired.json`, and
   reaped by `reapRetired()` on a later start once it is idle.

4. **An upgrade does not restart anything by itself.** `npm i -g lakonai` swaps
   files and runs no postinstall, while the daemon in memory keeps executing the
   `server.js` it launched with — new CLI, old proxy, and the fix the user just
   installed never reaches their sessions. `start()` has always known how to
   replace a version-mismatched daemon; what was missing was a caller. That is
   `src/proxy/refresh.js` (`refreshStaleDaemon`), run from the SessionStart hook:
   the one moment a new session is about to depend on the proxy. It acts only on
   a mismatch (an unstamped daemon counts as one, matching `start()`), never
   starts a proxy that was not already running, never throws into the session,
   and is switched off with `LAKON_NO_PROXY_REFRESH=1`.

`sessionsOnPort(port)` reads other processes' `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (via
`/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux, `ps eww` on macOS) to find sessions holding a
port. `proxy status` uses it so a dead daemon does not get reported as the
harmless "Claude talks to the API directly" — that is true only for sessions
started afterwards, never for one already pinned to the dead port.

## Installer (`src/install/`)

`index.js` orchestrates; `platforms.js` lists targets; `claude-hook.js` writes the
hook launchers + merges `settings.json`; `claude-commands.js` writes the
`/lakonai:gain` slash command; `paths.js` resolves home via `homedir()` =
`process.env.HOME || os.homedir()` (NOT bare `os.homedir()` — that ignores a
test-set HOME under Jest). `backup.js` backs up before writing.

## Benchmark (`scripts/bench.js`)

Runs `tests/fixtures/bench/*` through the filters and prints savings.
`tests/bench.test.js` asserts each case clears its `minSaved` threshold — a filter
regression fails CI.

## Output benchmark (`src/output-bench.js`)

`lakonai gain` shows BOTH input savings (deterministic) AND an OUTPUT figure — how
much terser the model writes with the rule. There is NO separate `bench` command:
`gain` measures it inline, at most weekly (`isStale`, 7-day TTL) and only at a TTY
(never blocks a piped gain), via the user's local AI CLI (mem-llm.callAgent, no API
key). `measure()` runs each prompt twice — baseline vs the rule injected as a
**system prompt** (`provider.systemFlag` → `claude --append-system-prompt`; prepend
fallback otherwise) — and compares output tokens. Cached in `~/.lakon/output-bench.json`;
`summaryLine()` renders it. Opt-out `LAKON_NO_OUTPUT_BENCH=1`.

**Baseline isolation (`callAgent({ ruleFree, cwd })`):** both arms must run rule-FREE
so the baseline isn't polluted by the CLI auto-loading the installed terse rule (e.g.
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) — otherwise the delta collapses or goes negative. We isolate via
the CLI's own flag (`provider.ruleFreeArgs` → claude: `--setting-sources project`, which
drops the `user` source) plus an empty `cwd` (no project CLAUDE.md leaks). We do NOT
redirect the config dir: on macOS that switches claude to file-based auth and it ends up
"Not logged in" (credential lives in the Keychain, keyed to the default config dir), so
the whole bench silently failed. The number is modest because agent CLIs are already
concise — shown honestly, not inflated (see `docs/output-bench-vs-caveman.md`). This dropped the old "offline /
never measures output" stance from lakonai's identity; `deps-0` still holds (the AI
CLI is external, not an npm dep).

## Testing & coverage policy (non-negotiable)

- **Jest**, tests in `tests/**/*.test.js`, assertions via `node:assert/strict`,
  `test`/`describe` are Jest globals.
- **Prefer in-process unit tests** over spawning subprocesses — coverage doesn't
  track child processes. Export pure logic and call it directly.
- Migrate `c8 ignore` → `istanbul ignore` (Jest doesn't honor c8 pragmas).
- Coverage target: **100%** (threshold gate at 80% in `jest.config.js`). Run
  `npm test` and `npm run test:coverage`. New features need tests before commit.


## The compression proxy — invariants (read before touching it)

The proxy is the only lakonai layer that sits in the request path of the user's
whole CLI, so it is built to fail *open*:

1. **Nothing is reported up without a TCP connect.** `daemon.start()` waits for
   the server to publish `~/.lakon/proxy.json` AND answers a `probePort` before
   returning `{running: true}`; `status()` requires pid alive AND port listening.
   Returning success straight after `spawn()` is what shipped the ECONNREFUSED
   bug in <= 1.2.2.
2. **The shell rc never exports `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` directly.** It sources
   `~/.lakon/proxy-env.sh` (generated by `state.envScript`), which re-checks the
   port on every shell start (`__lakon_probe`: zsh `ztcp` → bash `/dev/tcp` →
   `nc`) and leaves a user-set base URL alone. Proxy down = no compression,
   never a broken CLI. It also **unsets** an inherited `http://127.0.0.1:<our
   port|7474>` when that port is dead — a shell carrying a stale value from an
   older install would otherwise stay broken after the upgrade.
3. **The installer only wires the shell when the daemon really came up**
   (`install/index.js` → `wireProxy`). A failed start prints why and touches
   nothing.
4. **Port 7474 is Neo4j's** — the old default, and a real collision on dev
   machines. `DEFAULT_PORT` is 41474 and the server falls back to an OS-assigned
   port on EADDRINUSE. `state.LEGACY_PORT` exists only to see/stop pre-1.2.3
   daemons.
5. **`stop()` never signals a pid it cannot prove is ours** (`ownsProxy`: the pid
   serves the port, or its command line is `proxy/server.js`) — PIDs get
   recycled.
6. **A running daemon is stale code after an upgrade.** `server.js` stamps
   `version` into `proxy.json`; `start()` restarts any daemon whose stamp is not
   the installed version (a pre-1.2.3 daemon has none), and always publishes
   `proxy-env.sh` even when adopting a healthy one.
7. **Tests must never spawn a daemon or edit a real rc.** `LAKON_PROXY_DISABLE=1`
   (set in `tests/setup-env.js`) makes `install`/`uninstall` skip the proxy.

Env knobs: `LAKON_PROXY_PORT` (preferred port), `LAKON_PROXY_FALLBACK=0` (fail
instead of moving), `LAKON_PROXY_START_TIMEOUT` (ms), `LAKON_PROXY_DISABLE=1`.

Visible user commands: `install`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`, `revert`, `shim`,
`compress-memory`/`revert-memory`, `gain`, `doctor`, `peek`, `proxy`, `mcp`, `version`. (`backups` was
removed; `compress-memory` takes a freeform instruction + `--prune`/`--rewrite`
validation levels; `upgrade` self-updates via the detected package manager + an
oh-my-zsh-style `[Y/n]` prompt; `install` offers the shim only when a hook-less
agent is detected.) Everything else is automatic after install. Cross-platform
reality: hooks (filtering/learning/guards) are **Claude Code only**; other
platforms get the rule + `lakonai` prefix (compliance), or the shim. `lakonai doctor` shows
what's active.
