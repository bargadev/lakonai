## Real savings, measured

All numbers from live projects using `lakonai@1.1.1`.

**CLI filters** — output compressed before it reaches the model (React + TipTap + Yjs microfrontend, 2,185 files):

| Command | Raw | Filtered | Saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `git log -20` | 17,097 tok | 450 tok | **−97%** |
| `git diff HEAD~3` | 10,780 tok | 1,952 tok | **−82%** |
| `git diff main…HEAD` ¹ | 1,513,910 tok | 2,331 tok | **−99.8%** |
| `find src -type f` | 28,392 tok | 707 tok | **−97%** |
| `ls -la` | 913 tok | 212 tok | **−77%** |

¹ 182k-line diff — previously crashed with `ENOBUFS`. Fixed in 1.1.1.

**Read-guard** — compact AST subgraph served instead of the raw file (WhatsApp client SDK, 300 files, 816 nodes):

| File | Raw | Subgraph | Saved |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `WAProto/index.js` | 293,256 tok | 13 tok | **−100%** |
| `src/index.js` | 1,849 tok | 69 tok | **−96%** |
| `src/index.d.ts` | 1,470 tok | 37 tok | **−97%** |
| `ProviderPanel.tsx` | 1,400 tok | 33 tok | **−98%** |
| `server/wa-client.js` | 1,134 tok | 9 tok | **−99%** |

**Proxy compression** — what actually reaches the Anthropic API (real session, 49 requests):

| Content type        | Without lakonai | With lakonai | Saved    |
| ------------------- | --------------: | -----------: | -------: |
| npm test (652 tests)|       5,168 tok |       85 tok | **-98%** |
| Build log (80 lines)|       1,298 tok |        8 tok | **-99%** |
| JSON API (120 users)|       2,386 tok |      104 tok | **-96%** |
| Git diff            |      ~3,000 tok |  ~2,880 tok  |   **-4%**|

**Typical coding session:** ~53% savings from proxy alone, ~75% with graph read-guard.

`lakonai gain` shows your own numbers. `/lakonai:stats` shows all layers at once.

## Eight fronts, one install

| Front | What it fixes | How |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| **Output** | _"Great question! Let me explain…"_ | Terse-response rule — no preamble, no recap. Auto-clarity for edge cases. |
| **Shell input** | `git log` dumping 1.8k tokens of metadata | Filters **30+ commands** (git/ls/grep/tests/lint/docker/kubectl/aws…) before they hit context |
| **Reads** | `Read pnpm-lock.yaml` → 80k of nothing | Hook blocks lockfiles/`node_modules`, caps huge files and `Grep` |
| **Overflow** | 4k-line build logs no filter knows | Parks on disk, hands the agent a digest — `lakonai peek` reads it back |
| **Proxy** | Every API request carries raw bloat | Local HTTP proxy compresses request bodies before they reach Anthropic |
| **Graph** | File reads load entire source files | AST knowledge graph: serves a compact subgraph instead of the raw file (-87%) |
| **Pixel** | Skill files are verbose markdown | Converts skill bodies to PNG — vision tokens cheaper than text tokens |
| **Context** | MCP catalogs + memory re-paid every turn | Auto-compresses MCP catalogs; `compress-memory` via local AI CLI |

Auto-learning runs underneath all of this: lakonai detects new heavy commands and enables a safe filter automatically, no config. ([full reference →](docs/reference.md))

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g lakonai
lakonai install
```

That's it. From the next session your agent is terse, shell output is filtered, junk reads are blocked, the proxy compresses API traffic, and the graph intercepts file reads. Watch it in `lakonai gain`.

---

## Layers, explained

### Layer 1 — CLI filters (all agents)

Thirty-plus command filters run as a PATH shim or Claude Code hook before output ever reaches context. `git log -p` becomes three lines. A passing `npm test` suite becomes one.

```bash
lakonai git log -p     # → summary only
lakonai npm test       # → final counts only
lakonai ls -la         # → files without noise
```

### Layer 2 — Graph read-guard (Claude Code)

`lakonai graph build` parses your codebase into an AST knowledge graph — zero LLM, pure AST, works in under a second for most projects. When Claude Code reads a source file, the read-guard intercepts and returns a compact subgraph (symbols, edges, community) instead of the full text.

```
102 files → 512 nodes → 573 edges   built in <0.1s
file read: 2,835 tok raw → 300 tok subgraph  (-89%)
```

```bash
lakonai graph build              # build / rebuild (auto-annotates + embeds)
lakonai graph query "what calls parseFile?"
lakonai graph explain src/foo.js
lakonai graph path src/a.js src/b.js
lakonai graph html               # open interactive viz
lakonai graph watch              # rebuild on file change
lakonai graph annotate           # regenerate LLM docblocks only
```

The graph JSON is auto-added to `.gitignore`. Set `LAKON_GRAPH_CAT=0` to bypass.

**Semantic search** — install `@xenova/transformers` to unlock hybrid BM25 + vector search (BGE-small-en-v1.5, ~23 MB, runs fully local):

```bash
npm install @xenova/transformers
lakonai graph build   # first run downloads the model, subsequent runs are instant
```

On build, lakonai auto-annotates undocumented files via `claude --print` (Haiku, zero config for Claude Code users) and stores one-line search-optimised docblocks in `lakonai-graph/annotations.json` — source files are never modified. Only new or modified files are re-annotated (mtime-based cache).

Benchmark on the lakonai codebase itself (30 queries, 15 literal + 15 semantic):

| Method | Score | Literal | Semantic |
|--------|------:|--------:|---------:|
| BM25 only | 19/30 | 15/15 | 4/15 |
| Hybrid (BM25 + semantic) | **29/30** | 15/15 | 14/15 |

### Layer 3 — Proxy compression (Claude Code)

A local HTTP proxy on port 7474 sits between Claude Code and `api.anthropic.com`. It compresses request bodies before they're sent — the model sees fewer tokens, you pay less.

```
build logs    → -99%   (repetitive lines collapsed)
minified JSON → -96%   (schema-extracted summary)
test output   → -98%   (counts only, no per-test lines)
diffs         →  -4%   (conservative; context preserved)
source code   →   0%   (covered by graph instead)
```

The proxy starts automatically on `lakonai install` and runs silently. No API key exposed. Stats accumulate in `~/.lakon/proxy-stats.json`.

### Layer 4 — Pixel (Claude Code + Codex)

Skill markdown is verbose. A 3k-token skill file becomes a 170-token PNG tile. Vision tokens are cheaper than text tokens past the ~255-token break-even point.

```bash
lakonai pixel --dry-run      # estimate savings, no writes
lakonai pixel                # convert profitable skills (requires: npm install canvas)
lakonai pixel --agent claude # Claude Code skills only
lakonai pixel --revert       # byte-identical restore from backup
```

### Overflow sandbox (all agents)

When a command's output still exceeds budget after filtering, lakonai parks the full text in `~/.lakon/sandbox/` and gives the agent a digest: head, tail, exit code, how to query. Nothing is lost — it stops being re-paid.

```
lakonai: 4000 lines / 249KB parked in sandbox 30930a0c
$ node build.js  → exit 0

[build] compiling module 0 …
… 3980 lines elided …
[build] compiling module 3999 …

Query it: lakonai peek 30930a0c --grep "error"
```

## See your savings

```
lakonai - saved 196.8k tok (46% smaller) across 1910 commands

  today      984 tok saved  (17%)
  this week  124.5k tok saved  (57%)

  top: grep 55.3k · tail 55.1k · Read 34.3k · git 23.4k · cat 15.2k

  output (terse rule): ~52% fewer tokens (1332 → 634, 4 prompts) [claude]
```

Input is measured and deterministic. Output is estimated by your local AI CLI (no key, weekly). Both sides, one number.

**rtk** — CLI output filtering approach; lakonai extends with auto-learning and 30+ built-in filters.  
**Manual CLAUDE.md** — works, but you write and maintain it; lakonai installs and updates automatically.

## Test suite

725 tests across 47 suites — all passing, no mocks on I/O boundaries.

| Type | Suites | Tests |
|------|--------|-------|
| Unit | 13 | 183 |
| Integration (module + real FS) | 31 | 489 |
| E2E / CLI (spawn + real process) | 3 | 53 |
| **Total** | **47** | **725** |

Coverage: **95% statements · 89% branches · 97% functions**

Branch ceiling is ~90% — the remaining gaps are canvas-native rendering, platform-specific `fs.watch` fallback, and the HTTPS transport branch (all marked `/* istanbul ignore next */` with justification).

## Why "lakonai"

In 346 BC, Philip II of Macedon warned Sparta: _"If I invade Lakonía, I will raze your cities."_ The Spartans replied with one word: _"If."_ Their region, **Lakonía**, gave English the word **laconic** — using as few words as possible.

Your AI agent isn't laconic. It opens with _"Sure! I'd be happy to help…"_, repeats your question, reads `git log` in full, and sends every line of your test suite to the API. lakonai closes all of it.
